        <h2>Our Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          At NRG, design is more than aestheticsâ€”it's a statement. We believe in the power of subtlety, the allure of contrast, and the confidence that comes from wearing something truly exceptional. Our vision is to blend classic elegance with bold innovation, creating pieces that stand the test of time and trend.
